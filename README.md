dhcping-ng
==========

dhcping-ng is small tool for searching for dhcp servers in switched networks. It can be used for discovering rogue dhcp servers.

  - I'm was very unhappy with dhcping(debian)
  - mostly based on dhcp_discover from libnet 1.1

 - BUGS Reports /Feature requests always welcome.
